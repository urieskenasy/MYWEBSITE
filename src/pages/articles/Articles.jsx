        I was thinking to myself, what would be a nice way to bring a little
        more content to my web page, but also bring content that would be
        helpful and meaningful for some of us. The answer was very clear to me.
        when starting learning to program, I had some topics which were harder
        for me to understand, and back then I got many times frustrated,
        thinking to myself "am I stupid? maybe I'm not a fit for this job?" and
        more negative thoughts, and now I have a chance to try and explain
        myself these topics, and also to repeat it myself again...ðŸ¤“

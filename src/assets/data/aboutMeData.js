export const aboutMe = [
  "My name is Uri, I grew up in a small village near Jerusalem in Israel. I am married and have a cat who brings joy to my life. Outside of work, I have a passion for art, yoga, and music. I try to start every morning with a meditation and yoga practice, which helps me to center myself and feel grounded throughout the day. In my free time, I enjoy exploring different styles of art and attending live music performances. Overall, I am a creative and mindful individual who values balance and personal growth.",
  "I have a varied and dynamic professional background with experience in both customer-facing and technical roles. From 2014 to 2016, I worked as a coffee house manager where I gained valuable experience in customer service and team management. In this role, I was responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the coffee house, including managing a team of baristas, maintaining inventory and supplies, and ensuring that customers had a positive and enjoyable experience.",
  "In 2016, I took on a new challenge as a sales team lead for a cosmetic company in Switzerland. This role required me to travel extensively and work with clients across Europe. In addition to leading a team of sales representatives, I was also responsible for developing and implementing sales strategies, analyzing market trends, and maintaining relationships with key clients.",
  "Since 2020, I have been focusing on developing my technical skills and have been working to become a professional software developer. I recently completed a course in full stack web development at DCI, where I learned a range of skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, back-end technologies such as nodeJS, mongoDB, MySQL, and javascript frameworks such as Angular and React. I am excited to continue building upon my web development skills and bring my unique blend of technical expertise and customer service experience to future projects.",
